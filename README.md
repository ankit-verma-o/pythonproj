# Squirrel Sightings Application

We were asked to build an application that can import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data and allow to add, update, and view squirrel data.

When we open the application, the home page displays 3 buttons, namely: "Create a new sighting", "See Map" and "Some Statistics about Squirrel Sightings". Also the page displays the list of all sightings by their Unique Squirrel ID on the home page itself.

# Create a new sighting: 
When we click on it, it takes us to a new page where we can enter different sighting related informations such as Latitude, Longitude, Squirrel ID, Age, Primary Fur Color etc. Once filled, just click the "Submit" button to add a new sighting. It also has a link to go to MAIN PAGE in the bottom.

# See Map:
When we click it, it takes us to a new page which displays open streets map of Central Park and any random 100 squirrel sightings. The map changes every time you refresh.

# Some Statistics about Squirrel Sightitings

When we click on it, we get 5 statistics about Squirrel Sightings, namely: "Total Number of Squirrel Sightings", "Sightings in Night", "Number of Adult Sightings", "Number of Squirrels that were running" and "Number of Squirrels that were black in fur color".
